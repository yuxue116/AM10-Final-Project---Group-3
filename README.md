# Estimation of changes in air pollution during the COVID-19 outbreak
## Background:
The lockdown response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented decrease in global economic and transport activity. The movement of people and the corresponding activities of production and consumption have been significantly reduced. As a possible side effect of this reduction, air pollution in many areas may have been greatly reduced. Our group aim to estimate and visualize changes in air polluton during the COVID19. 
## Objectives:
* We will look at the air pollution of four cities that have all been affected by COVID-19 at different levels. 
  From our initial discussion, we have selected the following: London (United Kingdom); Wuhan (China); New Delhi (India); Auckland (New Zealand)
  In details, we will look at changes in concentrations of NOx, NO2, PM, O3, VOC, NH3.
* We will look at the changes in the community mobility of these four cities before and after COVID-19
* We aim to comparatively explore the changes in air pollution of these cities, comparing and contrasting the levels of ‘lockdown' measures put in place by local governments. 
* We will create informative visualisations to tell the COVID story, in addition to using ML techniques to understand the most significant factors of air pollution within the pandemic. Whilst we may have initial hypotheses, the data will speak for itself.
