# Estimation of changes in air pollution during the COVID19 outbreak
## Background:
The lockdown response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented decrease in global economic and transport activity. The movement of people and the corresponding activities of production and consumption have been significantly reduced. As a possible side effect of this reduction, air pollution in many areas may have been greatly reduced. 
Our group aim to estimate and visualize changes in air polluton in four cities we choose (London, Wuhan, New Delhi and Auckland) during the COVID19
## Objectives:
* Explore and visualize the mobility change

## Datasets:
[Air quality data](https://openaq.org/#/locations?_k=ggbbh8)
[COVID-19 Community Mobility Report Data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)
